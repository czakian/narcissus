About the Name:

Narcissus: Named after the greek myth of narcussus who looked in his own reflection in a pool fell 
in love with it, not realizing it was only an image. 
for more see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)

Idea:
The idea behind narcissus is to create a way to follow news stories in different countries and see how media
reacts to a single world event. The goal is to infer attitudes of countries towards each other and how these sentiments
are echoed in the media. 

Media shall include but not be limited to news websites, blogs, and online journals. 
--perhaps I'll try to add a formant parser for sound clips if I am feeling really amibitious.

Contact:
if you have questions about narcissus, please feel free to contact me at czakian (at) indiana (dot) edu
I expect that progress on this will be slow since (dr)operating systems has ambushed me this semester.
